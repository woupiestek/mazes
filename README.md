# mazes

Can I draw a maze I cannot escape from?

## Overview of maths & algorithms

For generating mazes: variation of reandomized depth first and 
breath first search.

The 'planar' ones create a graph of pointers and search that
graph of unvisited nodes. Some later mazes dont construct that 
graph, by relying on triangle groups, or in case of the last few 
spirals, just computing relative coordinates directly

For mazes on the hyperbolic plane: hyperbolic trigonimetry of 
course.

Spiral mazes: ordinary trigonometry.
